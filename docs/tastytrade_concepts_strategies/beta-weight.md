# Beta Weight

Beta weighting is a method for investors to standardize all their positions into a single unit, allowing them to understand how their entire portfolio will react to market movements. It provides insights into the size, diversity, and general risk of their holdings.

This calculation typically uses five years of historical data to ensure accuracy across various market environments. tastylive often beta weights to the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) because they primarily trade liquid mid to large-cap stocks that correlate with the S&P 500. However, if a portfolio is heavily concentrated in a specific sector, such as technology, beta weighting to a more relevant underlying asset like QQQ (Nasdaq 100 ETF) might be more appropriate.

tastylive uses beta weighting to ensure their strategies are not overly reliant on the market's directional movement. It serves as a tool to contextualize their overall market position rather than a precise number for calculations.
