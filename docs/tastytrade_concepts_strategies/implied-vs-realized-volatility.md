The article "Implied vs Realized Volatility: What is the Difference?" from tastylive explains the key differences between these concepts in the options market.

**Implied Volatility (IV)** is a forward-looking metric that reflects the market's expectation for the future volatility of an underlying asset. It is derived from an option's price using models like the Black-Scholes pricing model. When demand for options increases, IV typically rises, and vice versa. Studies suggest that IV often overestimates actual volatility, acting as an "insurance" premium.

**Realized Volatility**, also known as actual or historical volatility, refers to the actual movement of an asset's price over a specified past period. It is calculated by analyzing past price changes, typically using statistical measures like standard deviation or variance. While it reflects past performance, it can inform future expectations.

**Historical Volatility** is another term for realized or actual volatility, measuring past price fluctuations.

**Future Volatility** is the market's forecast of how much an asset's price is expected to fluctuate in the future. It is speculative and based on collective market expectations. Accurately predicting it can be highly profitable, but it is inherently complex. Many traders focus on mean reversion, where volatility tends to return to its historical average.

**Key Differences:**
*   **Historical vs. Future Volatility:** Historical volatility measures past price movements based on actual data, while future volatility is a speculative forecast of future price fluctuations.
*   **Implied vs. Realized Volatility:** Implied volatility is forward-looking and based on market expectations, often overestimating actual movements. Realized volatility measures what actually happened in the past.

**Calculation:**
*   **Historical Volatility:** Typically calculated using the standard deviation of an asset's returns over a specific period, involving steps like choosing a time period, collecting price data, calculating daily returns, finding the average return, calculating variance, and finally, standard deviation.
*   **Implied Volatility:** Derived from an option's market price using options pricing models like Black-Scholes. It involves obtaining the option's market price, gathering inputs (underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate), and then solving for the volatility value that matches the option's market price.
