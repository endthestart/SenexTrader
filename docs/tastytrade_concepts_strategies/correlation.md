The tastylive article "Types of Correlation: Positive & Negative Correlation" explains that correlation is the relationship between two or more variables, measured on a historical basis, typically with a minimum of one month. The correlation range is from negative (-1) to positive (+1).

Here's a breakdown of the types of correlation discussed:
*   **Positive Correlation:** This indicates that two stocks tend to move in tandem; when one goes up, the other typically goes up as well. It's measured on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0, with 0.1-0.3 being weak, 0.3-0.5 moderate, and 0.5-1.0 strong positive correlation.
*   **Negative Correlation:** This means stocks tend to move in opposite directions. For example, if one stock is up, the other tends to be down. It's measured from -0.1 to -1.0, with -0.1 to -0.3 being weak, -0.3 to -0.5 moderate, and -0.5 to -1.0 strong negative correlation.
*   **No Correlation:** When the correlation between two stocks is between -0.1 and 0.1, there is little to no relationship between their movements.

Understanding correlation is crucial for diversifying a portfolio with non-correlated underlyings, although the article notes that correlations can break down during market crashes.
