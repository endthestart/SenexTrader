The article "How to Trade 0DTE Options: Beginner's Guide" from tastylive explains that 0DTE (Zero Days to Expiration) options are options with zero days until expiration, existing for a single trading session. These can be longer-term options reaching their final day or specific options listed only for a single day. Approximately 46% of the total trading volume in the equities options market consists of contracts with less than 5 days until expiration.

While theoretically, any options trading strategy can be applied to 0DTE options, traders often use strategies that capitalize on rapid price movements or short-term market fluctuations due to their very short lifespans. Some popular strategies include:
*   **Naked Options:** Buying or selling options without owning the underlying security, hoping for a sharp appreciation in value (for buyers) or for options to expire worthless (for sellers). Selling naked options carries significant risk.
*   **Covered Calls:** Selling weekly or 0DTE call options against owned stock to generate income from the premium. This can limit potential upside if the stock price rises significantly.
*   **Cash-Secured Puts:** Selling weekly or 0DTE put options with enough cash set aside to purchase the underlying stock if assigned. This generates income and can allow purchasing the stock at a discount.
*   **Vertical Spreads:** Trading bull call spreads, bear put spreads, bull put spreads, and bear call spreads to limit risk while potentially benefiting from bullish or bearish moves.
*   **Iron Condors:** A neutral strategy used when expecting the underlying asset's price to remain within a certain range, involving selling an out-of-the-money call spread and an out-of-the-money put spread.
*   **Straddles and Strangles:** Used when expecting the underlying to move sideways (short straddle/strangle) or make a big move (long straddle/strangle).

Trading 0DTE options involves several risks, including:
*   **Sudden Gap Movement:** Can lead to substantial gains for long options but outsized losses for short options.
*   **Limited Time for Correction:** Short lifespans mean less time for adverse price movements to correct.
*   **Sensitivity to Implied Volatility:** Fluctuations can significantly affect option prices, amplifying gains or losses.
*   **Lack of Flexibility:** Less time to adjust positions or wait for favorable moves, increasing pressure for quick decisions.
*   **Illiquidity:** Can result in wider bid-ask spreads, reduced trading volumes, and increased slippage.
*   **Higher Transaction Costs:** Frequent trading can lead to increased commissions.

Virtually every stock and ETF with associated options offers 0DTE options, as all options eventually become 0DTE on their final trading day. Some, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), also offer explicitly listed 0DTE options.
