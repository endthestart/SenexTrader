A black swan event is a rare and unpredictable occurrence with a profound and widespread impact on financial markets. Coined by statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb, these events are outside regular expectations and carry severe consequences, often upending established norms and forcing market participants to reevaluate risks and assumptions.

Key characteristics of black swan events include:
*   **Rarity and Unpredictability:** They are inherently rare and unpredictable, falling outside normal expectations based on historical data.
*   **Extreme Impact:** They cause widespread disruption across financial systems, industries, or entire economies.
*   **Exposure of Vulnerabilities:** They typically expose hidden vulnerabilities or systemic flaws that were previously overlooked.
*   **Cascading Nature:** A localized shock triggers a domino effect, spreading instability across interconnected markets.
*   **Occur in Complacency:** They often occur in environments of complacency where systems appear stable.

Examples of black swan events in history include:
*   **The 2008-2009 Financial Crisis:** Triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market, it revealed systemic weaknesses in global banking systems.
*   **The COVID-19 Pandemic:** Caused an abrupt and severe stock market correction due to global lockdowns and economic halts.
*   **The Black Monday Crash (1987):** The S&P 500 plunged 20% in a single day, exposing vulnerabilities to new trading technologies and interdependent systems.
*   **The Dot-Com Bubble Burst (2000):** Fueled by speculative excess in technology stocks, its collapse devastated the tech sector and eroded investor confidence.
