# Calendar Spread

A calendar spread is an options or futures trading strategy where two positions are opened simultaneously: one long and one short. These are also known as 'time spreads', 'counter spreads', and 'horizontal spreads'. In options trading, calendar spreads involve the same underlying asset and strike price but different expiration dates. For futures, the strategy uses two or more different expiration dates.

This strategy is typically employed when the directional assumption of the underlying asset is neutral, especially in low implied volatility (IV) environments. However, it can also be successful with a slight bullish or bearish bias.

**Key aspects of a calendar spread:**
*   **Definition:** A low-risk, directionally neutral strategy that profits from the passage of time and/or an increase in implied volatility.
*   **Directional Assumption:** Neutral.
*   **Ideal Implied Volatility Environment:** Low.
*   **Setup (Typical Long Calendar):** Sell a near-term Put or Call and buy a longer-term Put or Call on the same strike.
*   **Max Profit & Breakeven(s):** Cannot be precisely calculated due to differing expiration cycles, but can be estimated. A guideline for max profit is for the trade to double in price, and breakevens are typically within 1 strike of the calendar spread's strike price.
*   **tastylive Approach:** Pick strikes near the stock price, or slightly skewed if there's a small directional assumption, and only route this strategy in the lowest IV environments.
*   **Closing & Managing:** Manage winners at around 25% of the debit paid to enter the trade. Since it's a defined risk debit spread, it's not usually managed beyond that.

The article also provides examples of long call calendar spreads, long put calendar spreads, and discusses short calendar spreads, which are less common.
