**What is the Dow Jones Industrial (DJIA)?**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or "The Dow," is one of the oldest and most recognized stock market indices. It comprises 30 large, prominent publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse industries, offering a snapshot of the U.S. economy. It's a price-weighted index, meaning companies with higher stock prices have a greater influence on its movements. While not directly tradable, investors can gain exposure through financial products like ETFs (e.g., SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA)).
