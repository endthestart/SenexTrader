# Contango

Contango is a market condition, most often associated with commodities and futures markets, where the futures price of an asset is higher than its expected spot price at the contract's expiration. This means a futures contract trades at a premium to the spot price.

Key aspects of contango:
*   **How it works**: In a normal market, longer-dated futures contracts are priced higher than current spot prices due to inflation, carrying costs (like storage), and other unknown market factors.
*   **Causes**: Contango is considered the "normal" state for most markets, as asset prices are generally expected to rise over time. It's associated with adequate supply, efficiency, and low price volatility.
*   **Example**: If crude oil is $70/barrel, a one-month futures contract might be $72 and a six-month contract $75, reflecting storage costs and future expectations.
*   **Advantages**: Contango markets are generally stable, with adequate supply and low volatility, which can be beneficial for traders seeking to avoid rapid price changes.
*   **Profiting**: There's no guaranteed method, but strategies like spreads (buying near-term futures and selling longer-dated ones) or physical product vs. futures trades can be considered.
*   **Contango vs. Backwardation**: Backwardation is the opposite, where the futures price is lower than the expected spot price, meaning the futures contract trades at a discount. This often occurs due to supply disruptions, geopolitical events, or expectations of declining prices.
*   **Bullish/Bearish**: Contango can be viewed as neutral or bearish, especially if a sharp discrepancy between spot and futures prices suggests oversupply. Backwardation, conversely, might be bullish on spot prices due to shortages.
