# After-hours Trading

After-hours trading refers to the extended trading session that occurs after the official closing of a stock exchange, typically for a few hours following the market close. This allows market participants to react to news, earnings reports, and other developments that happen outside regular trading hours. Pre-market and after-hours sessions are collectively known as "extended" trading sessions.

Key aspects of after-hours trading include:
*   **Time Period:** It starts shortly after the market closes (e.g., 4:00 PM ET for most U.S. exchanges) and continues for several hours, often until 8:00 PM ET for NYSE and Nasdaq.
*   **Participation:** It's available to institutional investors, retail traders with access to extended-hours platforms, and market makers.
*   **Eligible Securities:** Not all securities are available; typically, those with significant trading volumes and liquidity are included.
*   **Price Discovery:** Prices are determined by buy and sell orders, but lower trading volume can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and more volatile price movements.
*   **News Impact:** Trading is often driven by news events like corporate earnings or economic data releases.
*   **Liquidity:** Generally lower than during regular hours, making it harder to execute large orders without impacting prices.
*   **Order Types:** While market and limit orders are usually available, not all order types from regular hours may be offered.
*   **Risks:** Lower liquidity, wider spreads, and increased volatility due to news events are significant risks.
*   **Strategies:** Common strategies include gap trading, earnings plays, news breakouts/momentum trading, and scalping.

Benefits include flexibility for traders, the ability to react to news, and opportunities to capitalize on price gaps. However, risks such as lower liquidity, higher volatility, limited securities, and the presence of more experienced traders should be considered.
