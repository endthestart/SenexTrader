9.  **Protective Collar**: Similar to a married put, but an OTM call is sold to finance the cost of the protective put, capping upside potential while protecting against downside risk.
10. **Diagonal Spread**: Buying a long-term call or put and selling a shorter-term, further OTM call or put to reduce the cost basis of the long option.
