A covered call combines a long stock position with a short call position, a common strategy for investors and traders. It involves owning enough stock to "cover" any potential assignment from the short call. This strategy is generally deployed when an investor is slightly bullish but expects the underlying stock to trade sideways, aiming to generate income from the option premium.

**Setup:**
*   Buy 100 shares of stock.
*   Sell one at-the-money (ATM) or out-of-the-money (OTM) call option for every 100 shares.

**Benefits:**
*   **Income generation:** Premiums from selling calls provide income, especially useful during sideways market movement.
*   **Limited risk:** The primary risk comes from the long stock position, not the short call. The short call can even help reduce losses if the stock falls.
*   **Upside potential:** If the stock price stays below the strike price, the option expires worthless, and the investor keeps the premium.
*   **Flexibility:** Strike price and expiration date can be adjusted to suit investment goals and risk tolerance.
*   **Diversification:** Adds exposure to a different asset class while generating income.

**When to Use:**
*   When the underlying stock is expected to move sideways or slightly higher.
*   To generate income from an asset one is willing to sell at a certain price.
*   In neutral or slightly bullish markets.
*   For reducing risk or hedging, as the call premium can offset some losses if the stock falls.

**Maximum Profit/Loss:**
*   **Max Profit:** Achieved if the stock price is at or above the call's strike price at expiration. It's calculated by adding the call premium to the difference between the strike price and the stock purchase price.
*   **Max Loss:** Occurs if the underlying stock drops to zero, with the bulk of losses coming from the long stock position. The short call premium helps mitigate these losses.
*   **Breakeven:** Stock Purchase Price - Credit Received.

**Downsides:**
*   Limits the upside potential of a long stock position. If the stock rises significantly above the strike price, the investor is obligated to sell at the strike, missing out on further gains.
*   Can be complex due to evaluating strike prices, expiration dates, and risk profiles.
