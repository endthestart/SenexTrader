Interest rates are fundamental to financial markets, primarily serving as the cost of borrowing money. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, set base interest rates, which influence the economy by affecting consumer and business spending, inflation, and currency values. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth, while higher rates can curb inflation.

Yields, which are the returns investors expect from bonds and other fixed-income investments, are closely tied to interest rates. When central banks adjust the base rate, bond yields typically adjust in response. The price of bonds is inversely related to interest rates; as interest rates rise, new bonds with higher rates make older, lower-yielding bonds less attractive, causing their prices to drop and yields to rise.

Interest rates are determined by a combination of central bank policies and market forces. Central banks set short-term rates to influence economic activity, while medium and long-term rates are shaped by investor expectations regarding future economic conditions, inflation, and central bank actions.

Various types of interest rates are closely watched, including the Federal Funds Rate, Treasury Yields, Municipal Bond Rates, Corporate Bond Yields, Mortgage Rates, and the Prime Rate.

Interest rates affect the stock market in several ways:
*   **Borrowing Costs:** Higher rates increase borrowing costs for businesses, impacting profitability and discouraging expansion, which can negatively affect stock prices.
*   **Consumer Spending:** Rate hikes can reduce consumer spending, especially on financed purchases, leading to decreased revenue for companies and potentially lower stock prices.
*   **Investment Alternatives:** As interest rates rise, fixed-income investments like bonds become more attractive, potentially drawing funds away from stocks.
*   **Valuation Models:** Higher interest rates increase discount rates in stock valuation models, reducing the present value of future earnings.
*   **Risk Premium:** Rising interest rates increase the risk-free rate, requiring higher returns from stocks to attract investors.
*   **Capital Structure Impact:** Companies with significant debt are vulnerable to interest rate increases, as financing costs rise, potentially weakening profitability and stock attractiveness.

In the bond market, when interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds typically fall because newer bonds offer higher yields. Conversely, when interest rates decrease, existing bond prices increase. This inverse relationship is more pronounced in bonds with longer maturities.

Investors and traders use various strategies to trade interest rates, including direct bond trading, interest rate futures, and options on bonds or interest rate futures.
