The article "What Are Company Earnings: All You Need to Know" from tastylive explains that company earnings refer to the profits a publicly traded company generates, typically reported quarterly. These earnings reports provide transparency into a company's financial health, including metrics like revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS).

Companies are required by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, to disclose their financial performance quarterly to ensure transparency and fairness in financial markets. These reports help investors make informed decisions and allow companies to build trust with shareholders.

Key measures in earnings reports include revenue, net income, net loss, earnings per share (EPS), operating margins, forward guidance, and earnings surprises. While "earnings" and "income" are often used interchangeably, earnings typically refer to net profit, while income is a broader term that can include gross income or operating income.

Earnings season, which occurs four times a year, is a period of heightened market activity and volatility, especially for options traders. Implied volatility tends to rise before an earnings report and often collapses afterward, a phenomenon known as "earnings crush". Trading earnings requires careful consideration of risk due to the potential for significant price swings.
