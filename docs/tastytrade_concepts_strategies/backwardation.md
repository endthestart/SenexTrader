# Backwardation

Backwardation is a market condition, most often seen in commodities and futures markets, where the futures price of an asset is lower than its expected spot price at the contract's expiration. This means the futures contract trades at a discount to the spot price. This is considered unusual because, in "normal" futures markets, the opposite situation, known as "contango," is more common, where asset prices are expected to rise over time due to factors like inflation.

Backwardation can occur for several reasons, including a short supply of a particular commodity, leading market participants to pay a premium for immediate delivery. It can also develop when there's a widespread expectation that an asset's price will decline in the future, perhaps due to an anticipated economic recession, which would reduce demand. Supply disruptions, weather events, and geopolitical events can also contribute to backwardized markets.

For example, if crude oil is trading at $70 per barrel for immediate delivery, a backwardized market might see a one-month futures contract priced at $69 and a six-month contract at $67.

While there's no guaranteed way to profit from backwardation, investors might consider strategies like a "roll yield" approach. This involves selling an existing near-term futures position and simultaneously buying a longer-dated contract at a lower price, capturing the spread. Alternatively, advanced futures traders might execute a spread by taking opposing positions (one long, one short) in near-term and longer-dated futures contracts, aiming to profit if the prices converge over time.

Risks associated with backwardation include insufficient liquidity and higher-than-average volatility. Price fluctuations can be swift, potentially leading to significant capital losses. Backwardized markets may also present reduced liquidity, resulting in wider bid-ask spreads and difficulty in executing trades at desired prices. There's also the risk of a market reversal, where conditions swing back to contango.
