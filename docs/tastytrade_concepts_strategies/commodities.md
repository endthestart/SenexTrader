The article from tastylive.com explains what commodities are and how to trade them. Commodities are basic physical goods that are standardized and interchangeable, serving as raw materials for various goods and services. They are categorized into "hard commodities" (natural resources like oil, gold, copper) and "soft commodities" (agricultural products like corn, wheat, coffee).

The prices of commodities are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, weather patterns, and broader economic trends.

Investors can access global commodities markets through various instruments:
*   **Futures contracts:** Offer leveraged exposure to price movements.
*   **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Provide a simplified way to gain exposure to individual commodities or baskets of them.
*   **Stocks:** Investing in companies that produce or deal in commodities.
*   **Options:** Allow speculation or hedging against commodity price movements.

The article also outlines a structured approach to trading and investing in commodities, which includes evaluating your outlook and risk profile, conducting thorough research, developing a market assumption, choosing the right product, identifying opportunities, actively monitoring and managing positions, planning an exit strategy, and reviewing outcomes.

Reasons to trade and invest in commodities include portfolio diversification, acting as an inflation hedge, exposure to global economic growth, opportunities from market volatility, and access to leverage.
