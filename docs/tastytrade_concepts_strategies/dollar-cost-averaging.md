Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where a fixed amount of money is invested at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price. This approach aims to mitigate the emotional aspect of investing by removing the temptation to time the market. Instead of trying to buy at a market bottom, DCA encourages regular investing with less regard for prevailing market conditions.

Key aspects of DCA include:
*   **Risk Reduction:** It can help reduce the risks associated with inopportune timing by averaging out the cost of the investment, which smooths the impact of market volatility.
*   **Consistent Investing:** DCA fosters consistent investing habits and can be an effective way to build wealth without the stress of trying to time the market.
*   **Market Fluctuations:** This strategy allows investors to buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer when prices are higher, averaging out the cost basis over time.
*   **Flexibility:** DCA is versatile and can be applied to various market strategies, including buying stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs, and even selling or shorting positions.
*   **No Guarantee of Profits:** While DCA can reduce the impact of market volatility, it does not guarantee profits and may still result in losses if the asset continues to decline in price.

The frequency of DCA investments (e.g., monthly, weekly) depends on an investor's strategy, outlook, and risk profile.
