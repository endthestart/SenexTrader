Options assignment is the process where the obligations of an options contract are fulfilled when the holder decides to exercise their rights. When an option holder exercises, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) randomly assigns the exercise notice to one of the option writers.

For a call option, if the holder exercises, the seller (writer) is obligated to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. For a put option, the seller is obligated to buy the underlying asset at the strike price. Being assigned can lead to significant financial obligations, especially if the writer doesn't own the underlying asset for a call or lacks the cash for a put.

The assignment process generally involves four steps:
1.  **Option Exercise:** The option holder decides to exercise, typically when it's financially beneficial.
2.  **Notification:** The OCC is notified and selects a brokerage firm, which then chooses one of its clients who wrote a matching options contract to be assigned.
3.  **Assignment:** The selected option writer is assigned and must fulfill the contract terms.
4.  **Fulfillment:** For a call, the writer sells the asset at the strike price; for a put, the writer buys the asset at the strike price.

"Writing an option" means selling an options contract, giving the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price within a specific period. Writers receive a premium for assuming this risk.

Options are more likely to be assigned if they are "in-the-money" (ITM), meaning the market price is favorable compared to the strike price. Assignment is also more likely as the option approaches its expiration date, especially if it's ITM, because the extrinsic value diminishes. Dividend payments can also trigger early assignment for ITM call options if the dividend amount exceeds the remaining extrinsic value.

While it's impossible to know for certain if an option will be assigned, writers should always be prepared for the possibility. According to FINRA, only about 7% of options positions are typically exercised, but this doesn't mean writers will only be assigned on 7% of their short positions.
