# Bull Call Spread

Source: https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/bull-call-spread

A bull call spread is a bullish options strategy created by buying a call option with a lower strike price and simultaneously selling a call option with a higher strike price, both with the same underlying asset and expiration date. This strategy is initiated for a net debit, as the premium paid for the lower strike call is greater than the premium received for selling the higher strike call. It is also known as a "long call spread" and aims to profit from a bullish market outlook with both limited risk and limited profit potential.

**How it Works:**
The strategy involves buying a call option with a lower strike price and selling a call option with a higher strike price, both expiring on the same date. This results in a net debit, similar to a bull put spread, and is designed to capitalize on upward movement in the underlying asset.

**Maximum Profit and Loss:**
*   **Maximum Profit:** Achieved if the underlying asset's price exceeds the higher strike call option at expiration. The maximum profit is calculated as the difference between the strike prices minus the net debit paid.
*   **Maximum Loss:** Occurs if the underlying asset's price remains below the lower strike call option at expiration. The maximum loss is limited to the net debit paid when initiating the trade.
*   **Breakeven Point:** The strike price of the purchased call option plus the net debit paid.

**Pros:**
*   **Defined Risk:** The maximum potential loss is predefined and limited to the net debit paid.
*   **Defined Maximum Profit:** Traders know the exact potential gain.
*   **Lower Cost Basis:** Compared to buying a call option outright, it requires less capital due to the premium received from selling the higher strike call.
*   **Structural Flexibility:** Traders can adjust strike prices and expiration dates based on their outlook and risk tolerance.

**Cons:**
*   **Limited Profit Potential:** Caps the maximum potential profit, meaning traders might miss out on larger gains in strongly bullish scenarios.
*   **Cost of Entry:** Requires an upfront net debit, which impacts profitability if the underlying price doesn't exceed the breakeven point.
*   **Breakeven Point:** The underlying asset's price must rise above this point for the trade to be profitable.
*   **Impact of Time Decay:** While mitigating some effects, time decay can still reduce the spread's value as expiration approaches.
