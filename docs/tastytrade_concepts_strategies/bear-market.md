The article "What is a Bear Market & How Long Does it Last?" from tastylive.com defines a bear market as a period of prolonged decline in stock prices, typically characterized by a downward trend of at least 20% from recent highs. During this time, investor sentiment is generally pessimistic, marked by fear, uncertainty, and selling pressure. Bear markets often coincide with worsening economic conditions like a slowdown in GDP, declining corporate earnings, or geopolitical instability.

The duration of bear markets can vary significantly, ranging from a few months to several years, depending on factors such as the underlying causes, the state of the economy, and policy responses. Historically, bear markets have ranged from approximately 17 months during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis to about 30 months after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.

The article also discusses strategies for trading and investing in a bear market, including short selling, defensive sector rotation, seeking safe-haven assets (like government bonds or gold), volatility trading, dividend investing, value investing, and hedging strategies. It differentiates bear markets from recessions, noting that while bear markets are about stock price declines, recessions refer to a contraction in economic activity, typically defined as two consecutive quarters of declining GDP growth. Although often accompanied by recessions, not all bear markets are.

Key takeaways emphasize that bear markets are a natural part of the market cycle, presenting challenges but also opportunities for investors to purchase quality assets at discounted prices. Successfully navigating them requires discipline, patience, and a long-term investment perspective.
