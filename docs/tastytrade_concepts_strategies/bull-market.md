A "bull market" is defined as a period where prices are rising, typically by at least 20% from a recent low, and can apply to any asset class, though it traditionally describes the overall stock market. During a bull market, investor sentiment is generally optimistic, with confidence prevailing, and it often coincides with improving economic conditions like increased GDP and rising corporate earnings. Volatility is usually low, and trading volumes are robust, leading to broad gains across sectors and asset classes.

Bull markets can be triggered by strong economic indicators (GDP growth, low unemployment, rising consumer spending), corporate earnings growth, monetary policy actions (lower interest rates, quantitative easing), technological innovations, political stability, positive market sentiment, global economic factors, and the bullish outlook of large institutional investors.

Historically, bull markets occur with varying frequency and duration, often following economic downturns or bear markets. Since 1957, there have been 12 bull markets, with a new one starting roughly every 5.5 years, and the average bull market lasting about 3.8 years. Notable historic bull markets include:
*   **1949-1956:** A 7-year period of post-WWII economic boom, industrial growth, and technological advancements.
*   **1974-1980:** A 6-year recovery from the 1973-1974 market crash, driven by economic reforms.
*   **1987-2000:** A 13-year bull run fueled by technological innovation (personal computer, internet) and strong economic policies.
*   **2009-2020:** An almost 11-year market following the Great Recession, driven by low interest rates, quantitative easing, and corporate earnings growth.

To profit in a bull market, strategies include:
*   **Buy and Hold:** Purchasing and holding assets as their value appreciates.
*   **Options Strategies:** Buying calls or selling puts to capitalize on upward trends.
*   **Diversify the Portfolio:** Spreading investments across various sectors and asset classes.
*   **Consider Growth Stocks:** Investing in companies with above-average growth potential.
*   **Index Funds and ETFs:** Investing in funds that track major market indices for broad market exposure.
*   **Momentum Trading:** Buying assets that have shown strong recent performance.
*   **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Regularly investing a fixed amount to reduce risk at market peaks.
*   **Reinvesting Dividends:** Using dividends to purchase more shares.

Bull markets are characterized by rising asset prices, optimism, and increased buying, while bear markets are marked by falling prices, pessimism, and increased selling.
