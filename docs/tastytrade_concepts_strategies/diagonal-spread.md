The article "Diagonal Spread: How it Works & How to Use it" from tastylive.com explains that a diagonal spread is an options trading strategy combining aspects of vertical and calendar spreads. It typically involves buying a longer-duration option and selling a shorter-duration option with different strike prices.

Key takeaways from the article include:
*   **Definition**: A diagonal spread combines the different strike selections of a vertical spread with the different contract durations of a calendar spread.
*   **Strategy**: They are often set up like vertical debit spreads, where the long option has a longer duration than the short option, aiming to take directional assumptions with defined risk.
*   **Types**: Diagonal spreads can be bullish (using calls) or bearish (using puts).
    *   **Long Call Diagonal Spread**: Buy an in-the-money (ITM) or at-the-money (ATM) call in a longer-term expiration and sell an out-of-the-money (OTM) call in a near-term expiration to reduce cost basis.
    *   **Long Put Diagonal Spread**: Buy an ITM or ATM put in a longer-term expiration and sell an OTM put in a near-term expiration to reduce cost basis.
*   **Earnings Trading**: Diagonal spreads can be effective for earnings trades if the directional assumption is correct, limiting losses due to their defined risk nature. They aim to capture inflated implied volatility from the near-term short option while establishing a directional delta in a longer-term option less exposed to implied volatility crush.
*   **Profit & Loss**:
    *   **Profit Potential**: Relies on the spread moving ITM, appreciating to its full intrinsic value, plus any remaining extrinsic value in the long option.
    *   **Loss Potential**: Max loss is the debit paid upfront if the long option expires worthless, as it is a defined risk strategy.
*   **Management**: Management often involves rolling the short option out in time or closer to the long option's strike to collect more premium and reduce risk.
*   **Closing**: To close, route the opposite order for each strike held (e.g., sell the long call and buy back the short call).
*   **Comparison to Other Spreads**:
    *   **Vs. Vertical Spread**: Vertical spreads have long and short options with the same expiration, while diagonal spreads have different expirations.
    *   **Vs. Calendar Spread**: Calendar spreads have long and short options with the same strike price but different expirations, making them more about theta decay and IV changes, whereas diagonal spreads are more directional.
