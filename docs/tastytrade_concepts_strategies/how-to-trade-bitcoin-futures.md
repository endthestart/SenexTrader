The article "Bitcoin Futures: What Are They & How to Trade Them" from tastylive explains that Bitcoin futures are financial contracts allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin's future price without owning the cryptocurrency itself. These contracts are traded on regulated exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and obligate the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a specific future date.

The main appeal of Bitcoin futures is their ability to hedge against price swings or to speculate on whether Bitcoin's value will rise or fall. They offer leverage, meaning traders can control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital, which amplifies both potential profits and losses. Bitcoin futures are typically cash-settled, so no actual Bitcoin is exchanged; only the difference between the contract's agreed-upon price and Bitcoin's market price at settlement is paid out.

To start trading Bitcoin futures, one must open a futures trading account with a broker or exchange that offers access to cryptocurrency futures. It's essential to understand that these contracts involve speculation on Bitcoin's price at a future date. Traders need to formulate a market assumption, place an order, monitor market movements, manage risk, and eventually close their position.

Bitcoin futures attract both retail traders, who use them to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset, and institutional investors, who use them for price exposure, complex trading strategies, or hedging existing digital asset holdings. The price of Bitcoin futures is closely linked to the spot price of Bitcoin, but also influenced by market sentiment, speculation, investor positioning, market liquidity, trading volume, and broader macroeconomic trends.
