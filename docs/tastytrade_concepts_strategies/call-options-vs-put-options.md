# Call Options vs. Put Options

Source: https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/call-options-vs-put-options

A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before expiration, typically when they expect the asset's price to rise. Conversely, a put option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before expiration, usually when they anticipate the asset's price will fall.

When buying options, whether calls or puts, the risk is generally limited to the premium paid. However, selling options carries significantly higher risks. For call options, the risk is theoretically unlimited because there's no ceiling on how high the underlying asset's price can go. For put options, the risk is substantial, as the seller may be forced to buy the asset at a price much higher than its market value if the price drops significantly, though the loss is theoretically capped as the asset's price cannot fall below zero.
