The article explains that a double top is a classic reversal pattern that appears after an extended uptrend, signaling that bullish momentum may be fading. It forms when the price rallies to a peak, pulls back, and then retests that high without breaking meaningfully above it, creating two similar peaks separated by a modest decline, resembling the letter "M". If the price breaks below the interim low (neckline), it can indicate that sellers are gaining control and a trend shift is underway.

Conversely, the double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern that often appears after a prolonged downtrend, signaling that selling pressure is slowing and buyers are reasserting themselves. It resembles the letter "W", forming when the price drops to a low, rebounds, and then retests the same low but fails to break below it. If the price breaks above the peak between the two lows (resistance line or neckline), it's often viewed as a sign of a new uptrend.

Both patterns are more reliable when they align with broader market weakness or technical exhaustion for double tops, or improving sentiment or rising volume for double bottoms. Volume analysis can also help, with fading volume on the second peak of a double top suggesting weakening buying interest.

To trade these patterns, many market participants wait for a confirmed breakdown below the support zone for a double top, or a decisive breakout above the neckline for a double bottom, ideally on rising volume. Stop-loss orders are typically placed just above the second peak for a double top or just below the second low for a double bottom to manage risk. Profit targets are often estimated by measuring the distance from the pattern's peak/trough to the neckline and projecting that range from the breakout point.
