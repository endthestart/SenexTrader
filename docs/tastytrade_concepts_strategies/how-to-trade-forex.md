The article "How to Trade Forex: Step by Step Beginner's Guide" from tastylive.com explains that "forex" is short for "foreign exchange" and refers to the global currency market where currencies are traded. It is the largest financial market globally by trading volume, liquidity, and daily value, operating 24 hours a day, five days a week.

In forex trading, the value of one currency is quoted relative to another, such as EUR/USD or GBP/JPY, and traders aim to profit from fluctuations in exchange rates by buying low and selling high. An exchange rate indicates how much it costs to exchange one currency for another. The market is used for both speculation and hedging, with investors positioning for either appreciation or depreciation of a currency.
