# Call Options

A call option is a derivative contract that grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase 100 shares of an underlying asset at a specified strike price on or before the expiration date. The value of a call option increases if the asset's price rises and decreases if it falls. To acquire this right, the buyer pays a premium to the seller. Buyers can let the option expire if the stock price remains below the strike price, or sell the contract before expiration. If the stock price significantly exceeds the strike price, the buyer can exercise the option to obtain 100 shares, obligating the seller to provide them.

The three main characteristics of an options contract are:
*   **Strike price:** The agreed-upon price for exchanging 100 shares of the underlying asset.
*   **Expiration date:** The date by which the contract is settled or expires worthless.
*   **Premium:** The amount paid by the buyer or collected by the seller for a single contract.

Call options are typically bought when traders anticipate a significant increase in the underlying asset's price in the near future, often to limit monetary risk compared to buying 100 shares directly or if they expect implied volatility (IV) to increase.

**Long Call (Bullish):** The call buyer profits if the stock price rises well above the strike price by expiration, allowing them to buy shares at a discount or sell the contract for more than they paid. If the strike is below the stock price, the call is "in-the-money" (ITM).

**Short Call (Bearish):** The call seller profits if the stock price remains below the strike price, allowing them to keep the collected premium as profit when the call expires worthless. If this occurs, the call is "out-of-the-money" (OTM).

**Implied Volatility in Long Calls:** Some traders prefer to place long calls in underlyings with low implied volatility (IV) rank because the premium paid will be lower. As IV increases, option sellers demand higher premiums due to the greater potential for large stock price movements.

**Buying a Call Option (Long Call):** This strategy reflects a bullish market assumption. Investors buy long calls when they expect a significant upward move in the underlying's price past the strike price by expiration. If the option's price exceeds the initial cost, the buyer profits.

**When to Close a Long Call Option:** Buyers can sell long calls at any time before expiration for a profit or loss. Ideally, the trade is closed for a profit when the call's value surpasses its entry price. Long calls have unlimited profit potential.

Long call options can be closed by:
1.  Letting them expire worthless (OTM), losing only the premium paid.
2.  Selling the call option at a premium before expiration (OTM or ITM).
3.  Exercising the call and receiving 100 shares of the underlying (ITM).

Exercising a call option is rare because it means giving up any remaining extrinsic value. Selling the option and then buying shares at market price usually yields a better or similar result.

**When a Long Call Option Will Lose Money:** A long call option loses money at expiration if the stock price does not move above the breakeven price (strike price plus debit paid). The maximum loss occurs if it expires at or below the strike price.

**Selling a Call Option (Short Call):** This involves taking the opposite side of a long call transaction and typically reflects a bearish market assumption. Sellers expect the underlying's price to drop or remain neutral. If the option remains OTM at expiration, the seller keeps the premium.

**Short Call Option Assignment:** If a long call buyer exercises their right, the seller is obligated to make the exchange, usually incurring a loss. However, if there is substantial extrinsic value in an ITM short option, assignment risk is typically low.

**Call Option vs. Put Options:**
*   **Call Options:** Give the owner the right to buy. Buyers are bullish, sellers are bearish. Long calls profit from increasing stock prices and/or increasing IV. Short calls profit from decreasing, slightly increasing, or stable stock prices, and/or decreasing IV, as long as they expire OTM.
*   **Put Options:** Give the owner the right to sell. Buyers are bearish, sellers are bullish. Long puts profit from decreasing stock prices and/or increasing IV. Short puts profit from increasing, slightly decreasing, or stable stock prices, and/or decreasing IV, as long as they expire OTM.

**Buying a Call Option vs. Buying Stock:**
*   **Call Options:** Control 100 shares, have an expiration date, offer greater flexibility through strike price and strategies, and the maximum loss is the premium paid.
*   **Stocks:** Bought outright, closed only by selling, offer less flexibility, and the maximum loss is the share price going to $0.
