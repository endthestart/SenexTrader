# American vs. European Options

American options offer flexibility, allowing traders to exercise the option at any time before or on the expiration date, which is particularly advantageous for capitalizing on favorable price movements, capturing dividends, or acquiring shares early. This flexibility typically makes them priced higher than European options. They are commonly used in U.S. equity markets, especially for stocks and ETFs, and tend to have higher liquidity.

In contrast, European options can only be exercised on the expiration date, making them more predictable and simpler. They are generally priced lower due to this limited flexibility. European options are frequently used in index options and futures markets, particularly in European financial markets, and are often favored for longer-term strategies. They generally have lower liquidity for individual stocks but are highly liquid in index and futures options on European exchanges.

Key differences also include:
*   **Exercise Timing:** American options can be exercised at any time before or on expiration, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date.
*   **Premium (Price):** American options are usually priced higher due to their early exercise flexibility.
*   **Strategic Flexibility:** American options provide more strategic flexibility, offering more opportunities to capture gains or manage risk.
*   **Dividends:** American options are advantageous for capturing dividend payouts by exercising early.
*   **Settlement Type:** American options often involve physical settlement (receiving the underlying asset), while European options are more commonly cash-settled (receiving the cash difference).
*   **Settlement Price:** For European options, the settlement price is determined at the exact moment of expiration, which is critical as early exercise is not an option.

The choice between American and European options depends on a trader's individual goals, strategies, and preferences, as well as the specific market and product being traded.
