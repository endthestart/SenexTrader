The content of the article "Technical Analysis For Stock Trading: Head and Shoulders Pattern" from tastylive.com has been fetched.

The article explains that the head and shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal pattern in technical analysis, signaling that an uptrend might be losing momentum. It forms with three peaks: a higher central peak (the head) flanked by two lower, similar-height peaks (the shoulders). The price pulls back between each peak, creating a support line called the neckline. The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline, which is typically seen as a sell signal.

To identify the pattern, traders look for it after an uptrend, where bullish momentum weakens, and price action becomes uneven, with the middle peak (head) taller than the two flanking peaks (shoulders). The neckline can be horizontal or slightly sloped. Increased volume often accompanies the breakdown below the neckline, confirming the shift in sentiment.

For trading the pattern, many traders wait for a clean breakdown below the neckline, ideally with increased volume. Some enter a short position immediately, while others wait for a pullback to the neckline (now acting as resistance) for a potentially better entry. Stop-loss orders are often placed just above the right shoulder to limit losses. Profit targets are typically set by measuring the vertical distance from the top of the head to the neckline and subtracting that distance from the neckline at the breakdown point.

The article also describes the inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is the mirror image of the standard pattern, signaling a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. This pattern forms with three successive troughs: a first low (left shoulder), a deeper low (the head), and a higher low (right shoulder), with brief rebounds defining a resistance level (neckline). A break above the neckline, especially with increased volume, is seen as a sign of shifting momentum and a potential entry point for a long position.
