The article "What Does Bearish Mean in Finance: Definition & Strategies" from tastylive defines "bearish" as a negative or pessimistic outlook on the direction of a particular asset, market, or the overall economy, where prices are expected to decline. The term is believed to originate from the downward thrust of a bear's attack.

Key differences between bullish and bearish sentiments include:
*   **Market Outlook:** Bullish is optimistic, anticipating rising prices, while bearish is pessimistic, expecting falling prices.
*   **Price Outlook:** Bullish investors expect prices to go up, while bearish investors expect them to go down and may sell assets or adopt defensive positions.
*   **Associated Imagery:** Bullish is linked to a bull thrusting its horns upward, and bearish to a bear swiping its paws downward.
*   **Investor Sentiment:** Bullish sentiment indicates confidence, while bearish sentiment reflects caution and a belief that the market is overvalued.
*   **Potential Actions:** Bullish investors buy or hold assets, while bearish investors may sell assets, reduce risk exposure, or even short sell to profit from declines.
*   **Market Conditions:** A bullish market has rising prices and optimism, whereas a bearish market is characterized by falling prices and pessimism.

A bear market is a prolonged period of declining asset prices, marked by pessimism and investor caution, often triggered by economic recessions, geopolitical instability, or financial crises. These markets are defined by consistent decreases in asset prices, negative investor sentiment, and risk aversion, often seeing a 20% or more decline from recent highs.

Strategies for trading and investing in a bear market include:
*   Staying calm and avoiding panic selling.
*   Reassessing investment goals, potentially shifting from growth to capital preservation.
*   Considering diversification and rebalancing portfolios.
*   Investing in defensive assets like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
*   Avoiding attempts to time the market bottom.
*   Maintaining a cash cushion for future opportunities.
*   Continuing to invest and save, as downturns can offer opportunities to buy at lower prices.
*   Focusing on quality investments with strong fundamentals.
*   Preparing for market recovery.

Common strategies utilized during bear markets include short selling, hedging strategies, trading elevated volatility, tactical asset allocation, value investing, income-generating strategies (like covered call writing), and investing in gold and other precious metals as safe-haven assets.
