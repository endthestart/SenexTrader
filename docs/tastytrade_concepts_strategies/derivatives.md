The browsed content from tastylive.com explains that derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, index, or a set of assets. Unlike equities or bonds, derivatives are not assets themselves but are financial instruments based on the value of other financial assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices.

Derivatives are often used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. Common forms of derivatives include options, futures, and swaps.

The article details how derivatives work, their purpose (risk management, speculation, arbitrage, portfolio management, income generation), and their pros and cons.

**Types of Derivatives discussed:**
*   **Options Contracts:** Give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a predetermined price by a specific date.
*   **Futures Contracts:** Oblige the buyer to purchase and the seller to sell a specific asset at a predetermined future date and price.
*   **Swaps:** Two parties exchange one stream of cash flows for another, often used to manage interest rate or currency risk.
*   **Forward Contracts:** Similar to futures but are private, non-standardized agreements between two parties, typically traded over-the-counter (OTC).

The article also provides examples for each type of derivative and lists who trades them, including individuals, investment firms, hedge funds, and banks. Finally, it outlines steps on how to trade derivatives, emphasizing education, choosing a platform, planning, execution, risk management, and portfolio analysis.
