The page "Earnings Call - What Are Earnings? | tastylive" discusses earnings announcements, which are public disclosures of a company's earnings, typically on a quarterly basis, often quantified as "earnings per share".

Key points from the content include:
*   **Earnings & Implied Volatility**: Implied volatility tends to increase as an earnings announcement approaches, due to options buying for speculation or hedging. After the announcement, uncertainty diminishes, leading to a rapid decrease in implied volatility, known as "implied volatility crush".
*   **Trading Strategy**: Due to the implied volatility crush, premium selling strategies are often favored for earnings plays. This involves selling premium before the announcement and buying it back afterward, especially if the underlying asset shows little movement.
*   **Directional Trading**: Directionally trading earnings can be challenging, as stock prices may move contrary to expectations (e.g., going down despite exceeding expectations, or up despite missing them). Therefore, the focus is often on trading the implied volatility aspect rather than predicting directional movement.
*   **Risk**: Earnings trades involve high uncertainty and random movements, making them not suitable for all investors.
