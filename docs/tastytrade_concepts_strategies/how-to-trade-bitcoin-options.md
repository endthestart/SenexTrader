The article explains that Bitcoin options are financial contracts giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined strike price before a set expiration date. There are two main forms: crypto-native options, settled in Bitcoin or stablecoins on platforms like Deribit and CME, and equity-based BTC options, such as those on Bitcoin ETFs (e.g., BITO or GBTC) traded on traditional U.S. options exchanges.

To start trading Bitcoin options, if using traditional financial markets for ETF options, the process is similar to trading regular equity options, requiring a brokerage account that supports options trading. For crypto-native Bitcoin options, the process involves choosing a dedicated crypto derivatives platform, formulating a market assumption, selecting a contract, monitoring the trade, and managing risk.

The price of Bitcoin options is influenced by the price of Bitcoin itself, implied volatility, time until expiration, the option's moneyness, and prevailing interest rates. For Bitcoin options on futures, the futures curve (contango or backwardation) also plays a role. ETF-based Bitcoin options may also reflect the ETF's premium or discount to net asset asset value (NAV) and overall equity market sentiment.
