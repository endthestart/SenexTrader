A bull put spread is a slightly bullish options strategy created by selling a put option with a higher strike price and simultaneously buying a put option with a lower strike price, both with the same expiration date. This strategy is initiated for a net credit, as the premium from the sold put is greater than the premium paid for the bought put. It aims to profit from a moderately bullish or neutral market outlook, with both limited risk and limited profit potential.

Key takeaways from the article include:
*   **Definition**: A bull put spread involves selling a higher strike put and buying a lower strike put.
*   **Structure**: It's a type of vertical spread, meaning both options are of the same type (puts), have the same underlying asset and expiration, but different strike prices.
*   **Profit Potential**: Maximum profit is the net credit received if the underlying asset's price stays above the higher strike put at expiration.
*   **Maximum Loss**: Maximum loss is the difference in strike prices minus the net credit received, occurring if the underlying falls below the lower strike put at expiration.
*   **Breakeven Point**: The strike price of the sold put minus the net credit received.
*   **Pros**: Defined risk, defined maximum profit, income generation, profitable in bullish or neutral markets, and versatility.
*   **Cons**: Limited profit potential, breakeven point requirement, margin requirements, potential assignment risk, and market risk.
*   **Comparison with Bull Call Spread**: A bull put spread benefits from slightly bullish or sideways movement, while a bull call spread benefits from a more significant upside move.
*   **Volatility and Time Decay**: A decrease in implied volatility generally benefits the bull put spread, and time decay can also be advantageous, especially if the underlying price remains stable or increases.
